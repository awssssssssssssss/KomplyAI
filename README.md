## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) - Mocked for local development
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with Supabase adapter and OAuth providers (GitHub, Google)
- **AI Services**: Mock AI services for local development
- **Rate Limiting**: Upstash Redis (disabled for local development)
- **Testing**: Jest

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Local Development Setup

This project is configured for local development and proof of concept testing without requiring real API calls or authentication. All external dependencies have been mocked:

- **Authentication**: Uses mock authentication that always allows access
- **Database**: Uses mock Supabase client with sample data
- **AI Services**: Uses mock AI services that return sample responses
- **Rate Limiting**: Disabled for local development

No environment variables are required for local development. The application will work completely offline.
