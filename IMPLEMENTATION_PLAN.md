# X-Komply-AI Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
X-Komply-AI is an AI-powered DSGVO (GDPR) compliance tool specifically designed for German SMEs. The platform leverages AI and Large Language Models to automate and simplify DSGVO compliance processes, making it accessible and affordable for small and medium-sized enterprises in Germany.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
- **AI/LLM**: Mock AI services for local development
- **Database**: Mock Supabase client for local development
- **Authentication**: Custom mock authentication for local development
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Testing**: Jest
- **Monitoring**: Upstash Redis (disabled for local development)

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- Local development with Next.js dev server
- Supabase local development setup
- Environment-specific configuration

### Staging
- Vercel preview deployments
- Supabase staging environment
- Automated testing pipeline

### Production
- Vercel production deployment
- Supabase production environment
- Custom domain configuration
- SSL certificate setup

## Security Considerations
- Input validation and sanitization
- Role-based access control (RBAC) - mocked for local development
- Rate limiting for API endpoints - disabled for local development
- Secure storage of API keys and secrets - not applicable for local development
- Regular security audits - to be implemented in production version

## Performance Optimization
- Database indexing for frequently queried fields
- API response caching
- Image optimization
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- CDN for static assets

## Monitoring and Analytics
- Error tracking with Sentry
- Performance monitoring
- User analytics (privacy-compliant)
- API usage tracking
- Compliance audit logs

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Component testing with Jest
- Utility function testing
- API route testing

### Integration Testing
- Database integration tests
- API integration tests
- Authentication flow testing

### End-to-End Testing
- User journey testing with Cypress
- Critical workflow validation
- Cross-browser testing

## Success Metrics
- User adoption rate
- Policy generation accuracy
- Compliance improvement metrics
- System performance (response times)
- User satisfaction scores
