- Regular security audits - to be implemented in production version

## Performance Optimization
- Database indexing for frequently queried fields
- API response caching
- Image optimization
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- CDN for static assets

## Monitoring and Analytics
- Error tracking with Sentry
- Performance monitoring
- User analytics (privacy-compliant)
- API usage tracking
- Compliance audit logs

## Testing Strategy
