## Technical Implementation Priorities

1. **Database Schema Updates**
   - Extend existing schema to support new features
   - Ensure proper relationships between entities
   - Implement proper indexing for performance

2. **API Design**
   - Follow RESTful principles
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Ensure authentication and authorization
   - Add rate limiting for production

3. **Frontend Components**
   - Create reusable UI components
   - Implement responsive design
   - Ensure accessibility compliance
   - Add proper state management

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests for all new components and services
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - End-to-end tests for critical user flows
   - Performance testing for data-intensive operations

## Success Metrics

- All core MVP features implemented and functional
- Comprehensive test coverage (80%+)
- No critical security vulnerabilities
- Positive feedback from initial user testing
- Performance benchmarks met

## Dependencies

- NextAuth.js authentication system (completed)
- Supabase database integration (mocked for local development)
- AI service integration (mocked for local development)
- UI component library (Tailwind CSS)

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **Complexity of Data Mapping**
   - Mitigation: Start with simple file-based discovery and expand

2. **Regulatory Compliance Accuracy**
   - Mitigation: Focus on core GDPR/CCPA requirements first

3. **Performance with Large Data Sets**
   - Mitigation: Implement pagination and caching strategies

4. **Integration with Third-Party Services**
   - Mitigation: Use adapter patterns for flexibility

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementation of data mapping and discovery system
2. Update project documentation as features are implemented
3. Conduct regular code reviews
4. Maintain test coverage throughout development
